General Rules
-----------

.. TIP:: A quick link to the rules can be obtained in-game by doing ``/rules``


As much we want this to be a lawless land like in DayZ, there is still some ground rules that are required.

1. No using mods/hacks/glitches/modified clients/unfair advantages.
2. Combat logging players is not allowed. Combat logging will result in a tempban and a lost of that current life with items.
3. Raiding is allowed
4. Griefing is only allowed in the sense of raiding. You are allowed to break doors or windows to gain entry into a base. If the base is concealed and windows/doors are not easily accessible, raiders may tunnel until it allows them access to the windows/doors or into the base.

.. note:: You can hide your loot, but it should be accessable in a raid (i.e. No using glitches to hide the loot or make unbreakable walls.)

5. Spawn camping is not allowed.
6. Building/Basing is not allowed near spawn areas, against World boundries or in Out of Bounds area.
8. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

Project Zomboid Rules
-----------------

Deathmatching (DM)
^^^^^^^^
1. Do not kill other players on the server for no reason, you must have a very good roleplay reason to do so. Project Zomboid is all about character progress, when you kill someone you reset their character, forcing them to start from the zero. 
2. Do not ram others with your vehicle, that's still considered as a death match unless that person is posing a threat to your character's life. 
3. Killing someone with a misfire is not considered as death matching It happens sometimes. Exploiting this rule to commit constant deathmatching will lead to a permanent ban from the server. 

.. warn:: Punishment: Jailed for 20 minutes, multiple offenses will increase jail time also resulting in a ban.

Fear RP (NVL - No Value to Life)
^^^^^^^^^
1. You must value your life at all times, all attempts should be made to preserve one's own life. 
2. You should treat your characterâ€™s life as if it were real life and you only have one.
3. Putting yourself in the line of danger without a reasonable explanation for risking your life or another player's life, Is considered Fail RP. 
4. If a weapon is already drawn from both parties it will not be considered Fail Fear RP.

.. warn:: Punishment: Jailed for 10 minutes, multiple offenses will increase jail time also resulting in a ban.


Staff Rules
------

Staff is held to a standard and expected to follow the rules in order to enforce them. Staff are required to follow these extra set of rules in order to maintain moderation powers on the server.

1. Gamemode must be set to survival unless performing moderation tasks.
2. No using creative or ``/give`` to supply self for survival gameplay.
3. No using ``/tp`` to obtain information on players outside of moderation. (i.e. No teleporting to players to obtaining coords to their base.)
4. No using ``/fly`` or ``/god`` during survival gameplay.
5. No using any commands that normal players don't have access to that creates an unfair advantage. 
6. Staff is encouraged to use ``/v`` or ``/gm spectator`` while spectating players in the moderation setting.
7. No favoritism towards players. All players should be treated equally and fairly.
8. Respond to requests for service via the Tickets spawned from #support in a timely manner.
9. Use common sense.

.. important:: If you see a staff member breaking any of these rules, open a Staff Complaint in #support in the discord. http://discord.gg/Erg3fCV7zh
