.. important:: With 1.18 slated for release on 11/30, HCMC will remain on 1.17 until Spigot updates along with the core plugins. With how this update is set up, the world may have to be regenerated. I will be working with our MC team on how we will progress with the update. 

.. important:: Until we find a new plugin that auto respawns the ender dragon, request a Janitor or Custodian to respawn the dragon.

Rules
-----------

.. TIP:: A quick link to the rules can be obtained in-game by doing ``/rules``


As much we want this to be a lawless land like in DayZ, there is still some ground rules that are required.

1. No using mods/hacks/glitches/modified clients/unfair advantages.
2. Combat logging via mobs or players is not allowed. Combat logging will result in a tempban and a lost of that current life with items.
3. Raiding is allowed
4. Griefing is only allowed in the sense of raiding. You are allowed to break doors or windows to gain entry into a base. If the base is concealed and windows/doors are not easily accessible, raiders may tunnel until it allows them access to the windows/doors or into the base.

.. note:: You can hide your loot, but it should be accessable in a raid (i.e. No using glitches to hide the loot or make unbreakable blocks.)

5. Spawn camping is not allowed.
6. No setting TPs in or near other player's bases with the intent to raid.
7. Building/Basing is not allowed near spawn areas, against WorldGuard boundries or in Out of Bounds area (i.e. Nether Roof).
8. No using teleports/warps/ or ``/home`` in combat.
9. No using ``/ci`` or ``/clearinventory`` in combat or raids.
10. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
11. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.
12. No NSFW or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content
13. Use common sense.

.. important:: Tempbans issues due to a death is non-appealable unless you are killed due to someone breaking rules or due to a bug. Please included this in the ban request/ban appeal and how many lives you had before encountering the rule breaker.

.. note:: Ban appeals and request can be submitted at http://discord.gg/Erg3fCV7zh in the #support  channel.

.. important:: All ban appeals and requests are to be reported in #support on the discord. If you are banned from the discord, open a issue at https://github.com/OiivaeCommunity/ovicommunity/issues

Staff Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^

Staff is held to a standard and expected to follow the rules in order to enforce them. Staff are required to follow these extra set of rules in order to maintain moderation powers on the server.

1. Gamemode must be set to survival unless performing moderation tasks.
2. No using creative or ``/give`` to supply self for survival gameplay.
3. No using ``/tp`` to obtain information on players outside of moderation. (i.e. No teleporting to players to obtaining coords to their base.)
4. No using ``/fly`` or ``/god`` during survival gameplay.
5. No using any commands that normal players don't have access to that creates an unfair advantage. 
6. Staff is encouraged to use ``/v`` or ``/gm spectator`` while spectating players in the moderation setting.
7. No favoritism towards players. All players should be treated equally and fairly.
8. Respond to requests for service via the Tickets spawned from #support in a timely manner.
9. Use common sense.

.. important:: If you see a staff member breaking any of these rules, open a Staff Complaint in #support in the discord. http://discord.gg/Erg3fCV7zh
